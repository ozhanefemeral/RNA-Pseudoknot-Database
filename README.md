# System Overview
Welcome to the Pseudoknot Explorer project. This system is designed to provide effective extraction, storage, classification, visualization, and flexible searching of pseudoknot motifs in RNA molecules. The aim is to aid scientific research through a fully interactive, user-friendly web application.
The system consists of several interconnected modules:

## Frontend Module
This is the user interface presented in the form of a web application. It provides a seamless, ergonomic experience for the user to interact with the database, visualizing and exploring the pseudoknot structures.

## Backend Module
The backend module encompasses:

Data Processing: This segment is responsible for the extraction and classification of pseudoknots from 3D RNA structure files obtained from the RNAsolo repository. It characterizes pseudoknots based on a set of measurable parameters.

Database Management: This part handles the efficient storage of the extracted and classified pseudoknots. It also includes an automatic update mechanism that runs weekly to ensure the database content stays current.

Statistics: This keeps track of the changes in the database content over time, performs simple data analyses, and visualizes the results in the form of charts. 

The backend serves as the heart of the system, effectively managing data and ensuring the frontend has the necessary information for user interaction.

## Usage
The Pseudoknot Explorer is free to use for scientific purposes. Users can explore the available pseudoknot structures, utilize the search functionality for specific pseudoknots, and even visualize the structures using integrated tools.

By providing this platform, we aim to support and accelerate scientific research in the field of RNA pseudoknots.
